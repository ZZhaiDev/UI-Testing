# UI-Testing
### Accessibility data makes UI Testing possible
1. The better accessibility data for you application the easier it is to write tests and the more reliable those tests are over times.

### View is not showing or recording is not working
1. it might be a custome view cubclass that might not be accessible by default, or its actually not a view, its a graphics object in a lower-level graphics subsystem such as a layer or sprite.

### Poor accessibility data & Tools
1. UI recording
2. Accessibility inspectors
3. Interface Builder inspector enable Accessibility to improving accessbility

### Error: "Timestamped Event Matching Error: Failed to find matching element when edit button is clicked on cell swift"
1. You should add accessibility identifier to your UI Elements, and select them by code instead click on screen
2. when your app more complex then you want to select and layer behind another layer, how i can tap on screen? We should code.
